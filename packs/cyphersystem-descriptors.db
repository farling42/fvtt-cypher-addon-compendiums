That ability has made you sympathetic to what they really want or need. From your perspective, you’re just applying the old proverb that “it’s easier to catch flies with honey than with vinegar,” but others simply see your behavior as kindness. Of course, being kind takes time, and yours is limited. You’ve learned that a small fraction of people don’t deserve your time or kindness—true sadists, narcissists, and similar folk will only waste your energy.

You flee from threats and vacillate when faced with difficult decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Yet for all that fear dogs you and possibly shames you, your cowardly nature proves to be a useful ally from time to time. Listening to your fears has helped you escape danger and avoid taking unnecessary risks. Others may have suffered in your place, and you might be the first to admit this fact, but secretly you feel intense relief from having avoided an unthinkable and terrible fate.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You gain the following characteristics:</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Furtive:</strong> +2 to your Speed Pool.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Skill:</strong> You’re trained in stealth-based tasks.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Skill:</strong> You’re trained in running actions.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Skill:</strong> You’re trained in any action taken to escape danger, flee from a dangerous situation, or wheedle your way out of trouble.</p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><strong>Inability:</strong> You do not willingly enter dangerous situations.

These are villainous traits and some people want their PCs to be entirely heroic. But others don’t mind a little moral greyness thrown into the mix. Still others see things like Craven and Cruel as traits to overcome as their characters develop (probably earning them different descriptors).)</em></p>"},"_id":"2HMufAVpckfbjjTT","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"GwugNhp2lkJ6dwAa":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"cyphersystem","systemVersion":"2.0.0-b3","coreVersion":"10.288","createdTime":1666952038492,"modifiedTime":1666952168352,"lastModifiedBy":"Qe791PkMD1oOQLN2"}}
