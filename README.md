## Compendiums for the Cypher System

This package supplements the cyphersystem-compendiums module (https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium) by adding compendiums which include links for all the Types, Descriptors and Foci in the same supported set of books.

Each journal entry contains a link to the PDF page containing the actual description of the ability, which makes use of the PDFoundry module to display the links and open the PDFs.

For each type/descriptor/focus which contains abilities which are present in the cyphersystem-compendium, then links are provided in the journal entries of this module to those abilities.

Additional markers are present which work with the 'Nice(TSY) Cypher System Add-Ons" module (https://github.com/NiceTSY/nice-cypher-add-ons) to help automatically add links to these journal entries and the creation tool within the NICE module.
