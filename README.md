# Cypher System Character Creation Pack/Compendium

This is a module for use in conjunction with the [Cypher System game system for Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/cyphersystem/).

It works with the [Cypher System Compendium](https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium) to provide compendiums of journal entries for all the Types, Descriptors and Foci in the various books supported by that compendium pack.

Each journal entry contains a link to the PDF page containing the actual description of the ability. The use of the [PDF Pager](https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-pdf-pager) module allows the correct page to be selected in the PDFs.

For each type/descriptor/focus/flavor there is a link for each available ability to the abilities in the Cypher System Compendium.

Additional markers are present which work with the Sentence Linking and Creation Tool of the [Nice(TSY) Cypher Add-Ons](https://github.com/NiceTSY/nice-cypher-add-ons) module.

## Installation

The package should be available from the Add-On Modules, Install Module option of Foundry VTT.

If you want to install it manually, then enter the following into the Manifest URL at the bottom of the "Install Module" window:

https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-cypher-addons-compendiums/releases/latest/download/module.json

## Hard Dependencies

[Cypher SRD Compendium](https://github.com/mrkwnzl/cyphersystem-compendium) provides compendiums of Items (such as abilities) which are linked from the sentence journal entries provided here. See this module for how to set up PDF documents to work with pages properly.

## Soft Dependency

Additional markers are placed into each of the journal entries which provide compatibility with the Creation Tool component of the [Nice(TSY) Cypher Add-Ons](https://github.com/NiceTSY/nice-cypher-add-ons) module.

[PDF Pager](https://github.com/farling42/fvtt-pdf-pager) allows links to the documentation provided in each journal entry to be referenced by page number.
